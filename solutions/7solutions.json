Describe the different methods of asexual reproduction. Give examples.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Different methods of asexual reproduction are:<br />\n(a) Binary Fission: This process takes place in unicellular organisms. Parent cell elongates and gets divided into two identical daughter cells. Each daughter cell grows into an independent adult.<br />\n(b) Endospore Formation: In this method the spore wall is formed around a bacterial cell to form an endospore. This endospore germinates to form an active bacterium under favourable conditions.<br />\n(c) Fragmentation: In this process, body of the organism breaks up into two parts. Then each part grows into a new filament thus forming two organisms from a single one.<br />\n(d) Spore Formation: The spores are tiny spherical unicellular structures protected by thick wall. The spores are stored in a hard outer covering and this is called sporangium. Under favourable conditions the hard cover breaks and spores spread for germination.<br />\n(e) Budding: In yeast, new organisms are produced by the bud formation from the parent organism. After growing to full size, the bud gets detached and forms a new independent individual.<br />\n(f) Vegetative propagation: When vegetative parts of a plant like stems, leaves and root etc., give rise to new ones, it is.called vegetative propagation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Explain what you understand by sexual reproduction.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Sexual reproduction means involvement of two parents in the process of reproduction.

How does the process of fertilization take place in flowers?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>When the pollen grain reaches the stigma of a same species flower, it starts<br />\ngrowing out into the pollen tube of the stigma. This tube continues to grow inside the style till it reaches the ovule. Male cells are released into the ovule for the fertilization with the female egg cell and thus the zygote is formed. After this process of fertilization, the ovary develops into fruit and ovule into seeds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Describe the various ways by which seeds are dispersed.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Following are the ways in which the seeds are dispersed:<br />\n(i) Some light seeds like that of madar, which are hairy, dry and small are carried away by the wind to different places.<br />\n(ii) Spiny seeds and fruits like that of xanthium and urena, stick to the clothes of passers by and animals.

Explain how animals dwelling in the forest help it grow and regenerate.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Animals help in growing and regenerating forests in many ways. Animals work as the cleaning agents in the forest. Microorganisms work on dead bodies of plants and animals and degenerate them. An&#39;imals also help in pollination which helps in growing a number of plants. Herbivores helps the carnivores to grow as they serve as food for them. Thus flora and fauna mutually grow in the forest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Explain how forests prevent floods.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Forests can absorb a lot of water. The roots of the trees absorb the water and prevent it from flowing away. Roots of trees also help in percolation of water into the soil. This helps in preventing floods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. What are decomposers? Name any two of them. What do they do in the forest?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Decomposers are the organisms which feed on the dead bodies of plants and animals.

Explain the role of forest in maintaining the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Plants release oxygen in the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis. This oxygen is inhaled by the animals for respiration. During respiration, they release carbon-dioxide which is absorbed by plants. In this way the oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle goes on. Since forests contain a large number of plants, they help much in this cycle and maintain balance in nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Explain why there is no waste in a forest.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;There is no waste in the forest because decomposers convert all the dead bodies of the plants and animals into the humus which gets added to the soil.

This attitude of the people is so deeply rooted that it can not change all of a sudden. It will take a lot of time. Even though &nbsp;people are aware that discrimination is against the law, they continue to treat others unequally on the basis of caste and religion.

What did the court say in the case of Hakim Sheik?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The court said that the difficulty that Hakim Sheik had to face could have cost him his life. If a hospital cannot provide timely medical treatment to a person, it means that the protection of life is not being given. The court also said that it was the duty of the government to provide the necessary health services, including treatment in emergency situations. Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of providing essential treatment.

How can you say that adequate healthcare is not available to all? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;We can say without any doubt that adequate healthcare is not available to all in our country. The reason is that private services are increasing but public services are not. As a result private services are mainly available to people. But these services are concentrated in urban areas and are very expensive. Poor people hardly afford them whenever there is illness in the family, they either borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses. Thus, medical&nbsp;expenses cause great hardship for the poor. Therefore, they avoid to go to a doctor unless it is very urgent.<br />\nIt has been found that women are not taken to a doctor in a prompt manner. Their health concerns are easily ignored.

It means the work that is not seen from our eyes.

There are such works or tasks which are often not recognised as works and therefore remain invisible.</li>\n\t<li>Physically demanding. Very tough and difficult tasks. For example, women do a lot of work inside the home. Some of these works such as carrying heavy headloads of firewood, fetching water from a far-off place, washing clothes of the entire family members etc. are very tough and difficult. Still women do them regularly without making any complaints.</li>\n\t<li>Time-cosuming. Household works that take much time.

From the above description we can infer that there is a difference between the toys with which boys play and the toys with which girls play.<br />\nThe reason behind this is that our society makes clear distinctions between boys and girls. Boys are taught to be tough while girls are taught to be mild. Boys are expected to do works which highlight their manly features but girls are expected to remain in limit with all feminine virtues.

Two out of them are:<br />\n<strong>(a) Campaigning.</strong>&nbsp;It is an important part of the women&rsquo;s movement. It fights discrimination and violence against women.Campaigns have also led to new laws being passed. For example, in 2006, a law was passed to give women, who are prey to domestic violence, some legal protection.<br />\nThe women&rsquo;s movement also led the Supreme Court to formulate guidelines in 1997 to protect women against sexual harassment at the workplace. Women&rsquo;s groups also raised voice against dowry deaths. They demanded immediate justice for cases of young bides being murdered by their in-laws or husbands for more dowry. They did so by coming on to the streets, approaching the courts and by sharing information. As a result of their efforts, the dowry laws were changed to punish families who seek dowry.<br />\n<strong>(b) Protesting.</strong>&nbsp;The women&rsquo;s movement raises its voice when violations against women take place.

How are smaR businessmen affected in this age of advertisements? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Advertising a product is a costly affair no doubt but this is the only way to sell products in the market. Large companies have no dearth to money and therefore they can easily advertise their products. But these are small businessmen also who have no money to show their products on television or national newspapers and magazines. They often have to sell their products in weekly markets and neighbourhood shops.<br />\nAdvertising also makes us believe that packaged and branded things are better than things sold loose. We often forget that the quality of a product has little to do with packaging that it comes in. This shift to packaged products negatively affects the sales of several small business forcing people out of their livelihoods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Mention the drawbacks of advertising. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Advertising shows certain drawbacks which are as follow:<br />\n(a) We are citizens of a democratic country. It means we all are equal. But advertising always focuses on the lives of the rich and influential persons. It tends to promote a certain lack of respect for the poor. They are not the faces we most often see in advertisements and therefore we cease to think about them.<br />\n(b) Advertising uses personal emotions of the people. Those who are capable to buy certain brands feel exalted but there are many who cannot afford to buy them. The personal emotions of these people are hurt badly.<br />\n(c) Advertising promotes the sale of packaged products. This negatively affects the sale of things which do not come in packets. This forces many people out of their livelihoods.<br />\n(d) Advertising by focussing on the lives of the rich and famous helps us forget about issues of poverty, discrimination and dignity, all of which are central to the functioning of equality in a democracy.</p>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VII", "8.

In what ways is a hawker different from a shop owner?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;A hawker provides door to door service. He sells his goods by calling out the names of his items. He generally owns a thela which we may call a movable shop and keeps in it different items of our everyday use. He sells his goods at minimum profit.<br />\nA shop owner runs his shop at one fixed place. Whenever, we need any thing we go there and purchase it.

Explain how a chain of markets is formed. What purpose does it serve?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Goods are produced in factories, Goods are also produced in farms and in homes. But we are not required to go to factories or farms to buy goods of our need, because the producers are not interested in selling us small quantities. The wholesale traders do this job. They are the people who come in between the producer and the final consumer. They first buy goods in bulk. Then they sell these goods to the retailers, who finally sell this to the consumers.<br />\nFrom the above instance we come to the conclusion that from factories to final consumers a chain is formed, which we may call a chain of markets.

Even though we have no money in our pockets. The shop owner is bound to show the articles which the customer asks him to show. He cannot force the customer to buy any article. It totally depends upon him whether he buys any thing or not. We can understand it more clearly through an example. Kavita and Sujata went to Ansal Mall out of curiosity.

The worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society were the new changes. Brahmanas&rsquo; importance grew due to their knowledge of Sanskrit language. They were patronized by the Emperors. The idea of bhakti emerged among people. The merchants and migrants brought with them the teachings of Quran, the holy book of Muslims.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Question 6. In what ways has the meaning of the term &lsquo;Hindustan&rsquo; charged over the centuries?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>It has been observed that language and its interpretation change with the change of time. The term &lsquo;Hindustan&rsquo; was used for the first time by Minhaj-i Siraj, a thirteenth century Persian chronicler. He, with this term, meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. It was used in a political sense for lands constituting a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. Though the term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but it never included south India. Later in the sixteenth century, Babur, while using this term, meant the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. A fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau also used the term &lsquo;Hind&rsquo; almost in the same sense. The remarkable point is that while the idea of geographical and cultural entity like &lsquo;India&rsquo; did exist, the term &lsquo;Hindustan&rsquo; did not carry the political and national meanings that we associate with it today.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Question &nbsp;7. How were the affairs ofjaiis regulated?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>Jatis were the sub-castes which were grouped on the basis of economic and social status. They were ranked as per their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently. They varied as per the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jatis. Hence the status of the same jaii could vaiy from area to area Jatis had their own system of ruling. They framed their own rules and regulations for managing the conduct of their members. An assembly of elders was responsible for enforcing these regulations. This assembly of elders was called jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to abide by the rules of their villages.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>Question 8. What does the term pan-regional empire mean?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>The term &lsquo;pan-regional&rsquo; was used in the sense of the areas of empires spanning diverge regions. The dynasties like Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals extended their empires pan-regional. Though, not all these empires were equally stable or successful. But pan-regional rule altered the character of the regions. Most of the regions across the subcontinent were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. The emergence of many distinct and shared traditions in governance the economy elite cultures and languages were some of the prominent factors that took place as a result of pan-regional rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. What are the difficulties historians face in using manuscripts?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Manuscripts in early days were handwritten. Writers used palm leaves as paper for writing manuscripts. The historians used to copy down those manuscripts. Different historians presented their version in their own way as many of the words or sentences were beyond their understanding. So they copied what they understood. Later it was difficult to recognize which one was the original manuscript. Historians interpreted the facts as per the manuscripts which they got. Hence we find a number of facts with different illustrations in history.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Question 10. How do the historians divide the past into periods? Do they face any problems in doing so?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong>&nbsp;Time is not just passing of hours, days or years for historians. Instead it is the reflection of social, economic, cultural and religious changes that occur through the ages. Division of past into large segments&mdash;periods&mdash;make it easy to study time for historians. British historians, in the middle of the nineteenth century, divided time into three periods&mdash;Hindu, Muslim and British. This division was made on the basis of the fact that no significant change other than the religion of the rulers could occur during these periods. But as a matter of fact this division ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. Few historians take this periodisation even today while most of them take the economic and social factors into account in order to characterize the major elements of different moments of the past. The history of the past thousand years has seen considerable changes. As a result the sixteenth century was not the same as the eighteenth century or the eighth or eleventh centuries. Hence it is very difficult for the historians to describe the entire period as one historical unit.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Question 11. Compare either Map 1 or Map 2 with the present-day map of the subcontinent listing as many similarities and differences as you can find.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong>Map 1 and Map 2 given in the NCERT Textbook represent two different times. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by al-Idrisi, an Arab geographer. This section is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made by a French cartographer in 1720. Both maps are quite different from each other, even though they represent the same area. In Map 1 we find south India at the place where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. The place names are in Arabic. Some familiar places like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh have been spelt as Qanauj. In comparison to this Map 2 was made nearly 600 later after Map 1. By that time information about the subcontinent had changed a lot. This map appears to be more familiar to us. The coastal areas, particularly, are more detailed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 12.

Gram Sevak who is a government employee writes these records. There is no archive in our village. Sarpanch manages it. The documents stored there include the record of the land of the village, data of births and deaths, the number of public properties, data of health centres, etc. Villagers use these records.

He began to pay the soldiers in cash.</li>\n\t<li>Muhammad Tughluq shifted people of Delhi to Daulatabad in south and thus converted Delhi into a garrison town. He also disbanded the army. He also paid the soldiers in cash.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>9. Do you think the authors of tawarikh would provide information about the lives of ordinary men and women?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think like that. It is because the authors of tawarikh lived in cities mainly Delhi. They were not in touch of village people. They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. They had nothing to do with common mass. Hence, it was obvious that the information provided by them would lack ordinary men and women.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. &nbsp;Raziyya Sultan was unique in the history of the Delhi Sultanate. Do you think women leaders are accepted more readily today?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Yes, I think like that. The situation has changed today. Due to the spread of education people now realise the potential of women. So, they have started accepting them as leaders. Even in rural areas now we see women Sarpanches and Councillors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Why were the Delhi Sultans interested in cutting down forests? Does deforestation occur for the same reasons today?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The Delhi Sultans cleared the forests in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and gave these lands to peasants in order to encourage agriculture. They also established new fortresses and towns in these lands to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade.<br />\nNo, deforestation does not occur for the same reasons today. Nowadays, vegetation cover is being reduced due to over-population, urbanisation and commercialisation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12.

Who were the authors of tawarikh? Write in brief about them.&nbsp;</strong><strong>[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The authors of tawarikh were learned men. They were secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers who recounted events as well as advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. The authors of tawarikh lived in cities mainly in Delhi and therefore they were cut off from the village. They used to write histories in praise of the Sultans and in return got rich rewards. These authors advised rulers that they should follow an ideal social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Common mass had nothing to do with their ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Who was Raziyya? Why was she not accepted as a Sultan inspite of being talented? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Raziyya was Sultan Iltutmish&rsquo;s daughter. She became Sultan in 1236. She was very talented. According to the chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i-Siraj, she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But she was not accepted when she became a ruler. Those were the days when women were not allowed to enjoy independent identity. They were supposed to be subordinate to men.

How did the Khaljis and Tughluqs help the people of humble birth? How did it lead to political instability?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The Khaljis and Tughluqs raised people of humble birth who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients, the people of humble birth, were loyal to their masters and patrons but not to their heirs. Now Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Why did large parts of the subcontinent remain outside the control of the Delhi Sultans? What were the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>repurcussions? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans because they were very far from Delhi. For example, it was difficult to control Bengal from Delhi. This helplessness of the Delhi Sultans paved the way for distant provinces to get independence. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. It was a golden opportunity for the local chieftains to establish their rule in these regions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How did the chieftains arrange for their defence?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The chieftains fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. The bamboo had unique features. It was strong and even fire could not affect it because its several party were intertwined making them very strong. The chieftains lived in these forests which served them as rampart. They had everything necessary for life such as cattle, crops, water, etc. inside the forests. Thus, they were safe. Only powerful armies could subdue them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Why did Alauddin control the prices of goods in Delhi? What did he do for this?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Alauddin gave great importance to his soldiers because it was they who could defend the Sultanate from outsiders. He decided to pay their salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. For this Alauddin instructed officers to carefully survey prices. The merchants who did not sell their goods at the prescribed rates were punished.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Describe in brief Tughluq&rsquo;s policy of &lsquo;token&rsquo; currency.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Tughluq did not control prices of the goods. Instead, he used a token currency, made out of cheap metals, and not of gold and silver. People in the 14th century did not believe in these coins. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could be counterfeited easily.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9 Who was Sher Shah Sur? What do you know about his administration? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Sher Shah Sur (1540&mdash;1545) established a powerful state. He started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty known as the Suri dynasty. Although the Suri dynasty ruled for only a short period i.e. 15 years, it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin khalji and made them more efficient. The great emperor Akbar followed the techniques of Sher Shah&rsquo;s administration while consolidating the Mughal Empire.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Long Answer Type Questions</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>1. Give an account of Alauddin&rsquo;s administrative measures</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; During the reign of Alauddin Khalji Mongol attacks increased. It was a huge administrative challenge for the Sultan. He introduced several administrative measures:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Alauddin Khalji raised a large standing army as a defensive measure.</li>\n\t<li>He constructed a new garrison town known as Siri for his soldiers.</li>\n\t<li>The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50% of the pleasant&rsquo;s produce.</li>\n\t<li>He paid his soldiers cash salaries rather than iqta. This was done in order to make soldiers able to buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi. It was feared that merchants would raise their prices. In order to stop this Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Alauddin&rsquo;s administrative measures were successful because he efficiently withstood the threat of Mongol attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Give an account of Muhammad Tughluq&rsquo;s administration.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The early years of Muhammad Tughluq&rsquo;s reign faced Mongol attacks, which were curbed by Tughluq&rsquo;s sincere efforts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>He took several administrative measures like Alauddin Khalji he also raised a huge standing army in Delhi.</li>\n\t<li>He got emptied the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Delhi-i Kunba) in order to garrison his soldiers there. The &nbsp;residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south.</li>\n\t<li>He made arrangements for the collection of produce as tax to feed the soldiers. As it was very difficult to &nbsp;maintain a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes which coincided with famine in the area.</li>\n\t<li>Muhammad Tughluq paid soldiers cash salaries. For this he introduced &lsquo;token&rsquo; currency made of cheap metals. People in the 14th century did not trust these coins. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>3. &lsquo;Muhammad Tughluq&rsquo;s administrative measures were a failure&rsquo;. Explain withexamples.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Muhammad Tughluq&rsquo;s administrative measures were a failure, we can prove this statement with following points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>He campaigned into Kashmir which was finally a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army.</li>\n\t<li>His administrative measures created problems. He shifted the residents of the old city to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. People did not like this step taken by Muhammad Tughluq. They resented collectively.</li>\n\t<li>Tughluq, in order to meet the expense of maintaining a large number of soldiers, levied additional taxes which increased the burden of common people.</li>\n\t<li>The famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion.</li>\n\t<li>Muhammad Tughluq&rsquo;s policy of &lsquo;token&rsquo; currency also proved a failure. People of the 14th century did not trust this currency. They were very smart. They saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with the token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily.</li>\n</ol>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - History - VII", "4.

What were the relationships between the mansabdar and the jagir?<br />\nAnswer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Mansabdars were the patrons who joined Mughal services. They received their salaries as revenue assignments. This was called jagir. Mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagir. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments. This revenue was collected for them by their servants, while&nbsp;the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What was the role of the zamindar in Mughal administration?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Zamtndars were powerful local chieftains appointed by the Mughal rulers. They exercised great influence and power. They collected taxes from the peasants and gave them to the Mughal emperor. Thus, they played the role of intermediaries. In some areas the zamindars became more powerful. The exploitation by Mughal&nbsp;administrators made them to rebellion. They got support from the peasants in rebelling against the Mughal authority.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How were the debates with religious scholars important in the formation of Akbar&rsquo;s ideas on governance?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Akbar&rsquo;s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subject. This finally led Akbar to the idea of Sulh-i Kul or universal peace. He inferred that the idea of tolerance was of utmost importance because it did not discriminate between people of different religious in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics f.e. honesty, justice, peace. These were the virtues universally applicable. Finally Akbar, with the help of Abul Fazl, formed a vision of governance around the idea of sulh-i kul.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Why did the Mughals emphasise their Timurid and not their Mongol descent?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers. From their mother&rsquo;s side they were descendants of Genghis Khan, ruler of the Mongol tribes. From their father&rsquo;s side they were the successors of Jimur, the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey. However, the Mughals did not like to be called Mongol because Mongol&rsquo;s especially Genghis Khan&rsquo;s, memory was associated with massacre of innumerable people. It was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol competitors. On the other hand, the Mughals were proud of their Jimurid ancestry, because it achieved good name in the history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. How important was the income from land revenue to the stability of the Mughal Empire?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Land revenue was the backbone of the Mughal Empire. Without it nothing could be done. The king could not pay the salary of his soldiers. Neither could he do any welfare work. The administrative expenditure was so vast and this could be met with this revenue only. Hence, revenue was important to strengthen the empire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Why was it important for the Mughals to recruit mansabdars from diverse backgrounds and not just Turanis and Iranis?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Mughal Empire expanded to different regions. Hence, it was important for the Mughals to recruit diverse bodies of people in order to make people comfortable with them. Apart from Turanis and Iranis, now there were mansabdars from Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Like the Mughal Empire, India today is also made up of many social and cultural units. Does this pose a challenge to national integration?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;No. This does not pose any challenge to national integration. Unity in diversity is the special feature of India. Indians may belong to different regions, cultures, castes and creed. But this does not mean that they are different people. They are one and are proud of being bom in India.<br />\nSometimes social conflicts arise no doubt but they are solved in an amicable way. Whenever there is external threat, all Indians come together. The Kargil war is worth-mentioning here. India fought and won the war in the last. That&nbsp;was the time when everyone was filled with patriotic feelings. There was only one goal, Le. to win the war and that India did with the help of her brave heroes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Peasants were vital for economy of the Mughal Empire. Do you think that they are as important today? Has the gap in the income between the rich and the poor in India changed a great deal from the period of the Mughals?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Peasants are as important today as they were during the Mughal Empire. They cultivate land and grow crops without which we cannot survive. They pay land revenue to the government which is used in various development work. We cannot think of a sound economy without them. They are the backbone of the country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12. The Mughal Empire left its impact on the different regions of the subcontinent in a variety of ways.

[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>It was the policy of the Mughal rulers to campaign constantly against rulers who were not ready to accept their authority. However, when the Mughal became powerful, many other rulers joined them willingly. There were several Rajputs who married their daughters into Mughal families in order to gain high position. But at the same time many resisted the Mughals. The Sisodiya Rajputs refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. However, when they got defeat, the Mughals did not treat them badly. They honoured them by giving them their lands le. watan back as assignments, Le. watan jagir. Thus the Mughals never humiliated their opponents even though they defeated them.

Divide Akbar&rsquo;s reign into three periods and give details about them.</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>Mention the major campaigns and events of Akbar&rsquo;s reign</strong>.<br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Akbar&rsquo;s reign can be divided into following three periods.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1556-1570. Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. He launched military campaigns against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana to suppress the revolt of his half brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In the year 1568, he seized the Sisodiya Capital of Chittor and in 1569 Ranthambhor.</li>\n\t<li>1570-1585. Military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa.

Qandahar was seized from the Safavids and</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kashmir was annexed. Kabul was seized after the death of Mirza Hakim. Afterwards, Akbar started his campaigns in the Deccan and soon he annexed Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Write a short note on Akbar&rsquo;s administrativepolicies. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer: &nbsp;</strong>Akbar&rsquo;s administrative policies were mentioned in Abul Fazl&rsquo;s book the Akbar Nama, particularly in its third and last volume, the Ain-i AkbarL In the book Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces known as Subas, governed by a Subadar. The Subadar carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or Diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the Subadar was supported by several officers, for example</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The military paymaster also known as BakhshL</li>\n\t<li>The minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Military commanders called Faigdars</li>\n\t<li>The town police commander called Akbar&rsquo;s nobles commanded huge armies and had access to large amounts of revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Akbar wanted to govern his empire peacefully. Hence he gave utmost importance to the idea of tolerance because it did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. He held religions discussions with the Ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics and Zoroastrians and came to the conclusion that the idea of sulh-i kul or &lsquo;universal peace&rsquo; would work effectively. This idea focused on a system of ethics, honesty, justice and peace. These values were universally accepted.<br />\nThus, Akbar&rsquo;s administrative policies were based on considerate ideas,</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Who were mansabdars? What were their responsibilities?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people in order to run the empire smoothly. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars.<br />\nThe term mansabdar referred to an individual holding a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix rank, salary and military responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The mansabdars were assigned to military responsibilities. For this they maintained a specified number of sowar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Why did the peasantry suffer a lot during the last years of Aurangzeb&rsquo;s reign? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Mansabdars, recruited by the Mughals to discharge Mughal services, received their salaries as revenue assignments known as jagirs. But most mansabdars did pot actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while they served in some other part of the country. Akbar managed to carefully assess these jagirs so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. But Aurangzeb failed to do this. During his reign the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. As Aurangzeb could not control these developments, the peasantry suffered a lot. They had to give the revenue under all circumstances which made their life miserable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Write in brief about the Mughal Empire in the 17th century and afterwards. [Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> (a) The influence and power of the Mughals were at the height during the 17th century. The sheen of their administrative and military efficiency brought great economic and commercial prosperity in the Empire. They had huge treasure of wealth. They led highly luxurious life. But the common mass had to face the curse of poverty.&nbsp;<br />\n(b) The Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spend a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supported them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the peasants and artisans. The poorest among them led a very miserable life. It was not possible for them to invest in additional resources like tools and supplies in order to increase productivity. However, the wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. The Mughal elites exercised a great deal of power in the late 17th century. With the decline of the Mughal power and influence, many nobles became independent. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces, such as Hyderabad and Awadh.</p>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - History - VII", "5.

What role did the Yamuna play in the layout of the new Mughal city at Shahjahanabad?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The river Yamuna had a very significant role in the layout of the new Mughal city at Shahjahanabad. Shah Jahan preferred the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal. He developed the same architectural form as a means to control the access that the nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad the imperial palace also commanded the river-front. Only the most favoured nobles were given access to the river.

Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Kings built temples to show their devotion to God and their power and wealth. King Rajarajeshvara built Rajarajeshvara temple for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Here, the names of the king and the god appear to be similar. The king took the god&rsquo;s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god.

The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped the deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. Kings built temples but when they attacked one another&rsquo;s kingdoms they often targeted these buildings.

What made the city of Masulipatnam populous and prosperous?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The city of Masulipatnam was a centre of intense activity during the 17th century. Both the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control this city as it became the most important part on the Andhra coast. Qutb Shah rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items in order to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. This led to a fierce competition among various trading groups such as the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis and European traders.

How did the system of advances snatch the freedom of the weavers?</strong><br />\n<strong>OR</strong><br />\n<strong>How did the Indian Crafts persons lose their independence?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The Indian textiles were in great demand in the European markets. As a result, the English began to make attempts to control the Indian craftspersons by appointing Indian traders as their agents. They introduced the system of advances under which the weavers had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. Instead, they had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the company agents. This system snatched the freedom of the Indian weavers. They began to be guided by someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Answer Type Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Describe the trade activities of the big and small traders belonging to the medieval time.<br />\nAnswer:&nbsp;</strong>There were many kinds of traders. These included the Banjaras and several traders especially horse traders.<br />\nThe traders usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in South India from the eighth century onwards&mdash;the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. There were also communities like the Chettiyars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the major trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders,including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, South east Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China.</p>\n\n<p>The towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red sea ports were bought by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching high profits. This ultimately drew European traders to India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Describe Swat as a gateway to the West. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Surat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (now Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad. Surat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf or Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here.<br />\nSurat was a cosmopolitan city inhabited by people of all castes and creeds. In the 17th century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and warehouses at Surat. Several retail and wholesale shops could be found in Surat. These shops sold cotton textiles. Here, it is worth mentioning that the textiles of Surat were famous for their gold lace borders, le. zari and had a market in West Asia, African and Europe. The state provided all the facilities to the people who came to the city from all over the world. The Kathiawad seths or mahqjaxvs had huge banking houses at Surat. The Surat hundis were honoured in far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium.</p>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - History - VII", "7.

How was the administration of the Ahom state organized?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were known as peaks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation.<br />\nPeople of densely populated areas were shifted to thinly populated areas. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the 17th centuiy the administration became quite centralised.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. What changes took place in vama-based society?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The following changes took place in uama-based society:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Smaller castes or jatis emerged within vamas.</li>\n\t<li>On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste- based society and given the status of jatis.</li>\n\t<li>Specialised artisans such as smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.</li>\n\t<li>Jatis rather than vama became the basis for organising society.</li>\n\t<li>Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful.</li>\n\t<li>Many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.</li>\n\t<li>Many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam. They continued to reject the caste-system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>7. How did tribal societies change after being organised into a state?<br />\nAnswer:&nbsp;</strong>The emergence of large states changed the nature of tribal societies. We can understand this with the help of two examples&mdash;the Gond society and the Ahom society.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>The Gond Society.</strong>&nbsp;Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised<br />\n\tas Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of &lsquo;Sangram Shah&rsquo;.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The Ahom Society.</strong>&nbsp;The Ahoms built a large state which broughtmany changes in the Ahom society. The influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh, Hinduism became the predominant religions. But the Ahom Kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>8. Were the Banjaras important for the economy?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Banjaras were very important for the economy. They were trader-nomads and controlled trade and commerce. They played an important role in transporting grain to the city markets. They usually bought grain where it was cheaply available and carried it to places where it was dearer. From there, they again reloaded their oxen with anything that could be profitably sold in other places.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. In what ways was the history of the Gonds different from that of the Ahoms? Were there any similarities?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The history of the Gonds was different from that of the Ahoms in the following ways:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana. The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the 13th century.</li>\n\t<li>The Gonds practised shifting cultivation. The Ahoms did not practise this type of cultivation.</li>\n\t<li>The Gond society was not as much developed as the Ahom&rsquo;s. The Ahoms built a large state by using firearms. They could even make high quality gunpower and cannons.</li>\n\t<li>The Ahom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. We do not find these things in the Gond society.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>There were many similarities between the Gonds and Ahoms:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Both were capable of building large states.</li>\n\t<li>Both had to face Mughal attack. Despite their brave defence, both were defeated by the Mughals.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;Both of them granted land to the Brahmanas, who became very influential.</li>\n\t<li>We find the administration centralised in the history of the Gonds as well as the Ahoms.</li>\n</ul>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - History - VII", "7.

Its authority in social and political matters also increased. Hence, conquerors tried to establish control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Why were temples built in Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Temple building in Bengal from the late 15th century gained momentum in the 19th century. Individuals or groups built temples to demonstrate their power and affluence. Some of the temples got constructed with the support of several low social groups. Some families belonging to these social groups availed of the new economic opportunities with the arrival of the European trading companies with the improvement in their social and economic position they also built temples to show their status. The local deities once worshipped in thatched huts in villages were now gained recognition of the Brahmanas. This recognition shifted them from the thatched huts to brick-built temples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Describe the most important features of the culture of your region, focussing on buildings, performing arts and painting.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;I live in Delhi. Right from the beginning it has been a land of mixed cultures. In old days, it was invaded by a number of foreign rulers. Some of&nbsp;them stayed here for sometime and some settledown permanently. They all affected its culture, language, religion, society, architecture, art and painting. Still we have buildings and monuments built by Mughal emperors, slave emperors, Rajput rulers and many more. We have temples, mosques and many other such places constructed by different rulers. Differences of cultures can still be seen in the areas of old Delhi and new Delhi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Do you use different languages for (a) speaking, (b) reading, (c) writing?

Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer</strong>: The Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the ninth century in the south-western part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala.

What do you know about Rajput tradition of heroism? Write in brief [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Rajputs are closely associated with the culture of Rajasthan. It is they who made this culture distinctive. The cultural traditions of Rajasthan were linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. The name of Prithviraj is worth-mentioning because he was one of the ablest Rajput rulers. These Rajput rulers ares known for their bravery and sense of sacrifice. They cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their examples. Ordinary people also liked these stories which often depicted dramatic situations and a range of strong emotions in the forms of loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. &nbsp;Give a detailed description ofKathak, a popular classical dance form of north India. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The term Kathak is derived from Katha, a word used in Sanskrit and other languages for story. The Kathaks were originally a caste of story-tellers in temples :of north India, who beautified their performances with gestures and songs. Kathak&nbsp;began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the 15th and 16th centuries with the spread of the Bhakti movement. The legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays known as rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the Kathak story-tellers. Kathak was performed in the Mughal court. Here, it acquired its present features and developed into a form of dance with a distinctive style. Afterwards, it developed in two traditions known as gharanas&mdash;one in the courts of Rajasthan, Jaipur and the other in Lucknow. Kathak grew into a major art form only under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh. By the third quarter of the 19th century it was firmly established as a dance form not only in these two regions but also in the adjoining areas of present-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Emphasis was laid on intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes as well as on the enactment of stories. Although most British administrators never favoured Kathak, it survived and continued to be performed by courtesans. It was recognised as a classical dance form after the country got independence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q.3How did Bengali develop as a regional language? &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans</strong>:Bengali is said to have been derived from Sanskrit but early Sanskrit texts derived it. Now the question arises how did this language develop. From the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties developed between Bengal and Magadha which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. From the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas. Between the 14th and 15th centuries Bengal was ruled by Sultans. In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal Suba, While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language.</p>\n\n<p>By the 15th century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution.

This led to the regional state-building in Punjab. Guru Gobind Singh fought many battles against the Rajputs as well as Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh in 1708, the Khalsa revolted against the Mughal authority under the leadership of Banda Bahadur and declared their sovereign rule. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. In the 18th century, the Sikhs organised themselves into a number of bands called jathas and later on rrdsls. Their well-knit organisation enabled them to put up successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahamd Shah Abdali.

The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by Asaf Jah.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>9. Do you think merchants and bankers today have the kind of influence they had in the eighteenth century?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; During the 18th century merchants were more influential than the bankers. They used to provide more loan opportunities at higher interest rates. But now, with the spread of education people prefer banks which provide loans and other financial assistance at cheaper rates. Bankers also provide subsidy on the interest rate. They have different scopes of loans for different purposes. So they are more influential today than the merchants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10.

How did the later Mughal emperors lose their control over their nobles? [V. Imp.]&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The efficiency of the imperial administration broke down under the later Mughal emperors. It became increasingly difficult for them to keep a check on their powerful Nobles appointed as governors often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration as well. This gave them extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal empire.

Describe the impact of Nadir Shah&rsquo;s invasion upon Delhi. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Nadir Shah, the ruler of Iran, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. As a result, the Mughal treasury became vacant. Delhi turned into a deserted place. The wealthy now became beggars. There spread chaos everywhere. Those who once set the style in clothes now went naked and those owned property were now homeless. The New City, Le. Shahjahanabad turned into rubble.

How did Burhan-ul-Mulk reduce Mughal influence in the Awadh region? [V. Imp.]&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Burhan-ul-Mulk tried to reduce Mughal influence in the Awadh region by taking following steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>He first of all reduced the number of office holders [jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals.</li>\n\t<li>He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions.</li>\n\t<li>The accounts of jagirdarswere checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were re-assessed by officials appointed by the Nawab&rsquo;s court.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>5. How did moneylenders and bakers achieve influential position in the state of Awadh? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>Describe the close connection between the state of Awadh and bankers.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The state of Awadh depended on local bankers and mahcyans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These revenue farmers known as jaradars agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn the revenue farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments made the positions of moneylenders and bankers influential. They began to influence the management of the state&rsquo;s revenue system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How did Murshid Quli Khan become powerful in Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Under Murshid Quli Khan, Bengal gradually broke away from Mughal control. He was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Soon, he began to command the revenue administration of the state. In order to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major re-assessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Who were the Jats? How did they consolidate their power during the late 17th and 18th centuries?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The Jats were prosperous agriculturists. Like other states they also consolidated their power during the late 17th and 18th centuries. Under the leadership of Churaman they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi. By the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. Towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became major trading centres in the areas dominated by them.

The Mughal Empire had to face a variety of crises towards the closing years of the 17th century. What were the causes behind it?</strong><br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Or</strong><br />\n<strong>What were the causes of the fad of the Mughal Empire? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;There were a number of factors that led to the decline of the Mughal Empire.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Emperor Aurangzeb fought a long war in the Deccan. As a result, the military and financial resources of his empire got depleted.</li>\n\t<li>The successors of Aurangzeb were not at all efficient. The efficiency of the imperial administration broke down. It became increasingly difficult for later Mughal emperors to keep a check on their powerful Nobles appointed as governors often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration as well. This gave them extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal Empire.</li>\n\t<li>Under the later Mughals, peasant and zamindar rebellions increased in many parts of northern and western India. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes. The local chieftains were also becoming powerful by seizing the economic resources of the region.</li>\n\t<li>In the midst of economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. Again, Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761. These invasions further weakened the Mughal Empire.</li>\n\t<li>The competitions amongst different groups of nobles also proved unfortunate for the Mughal Empire. The later Mughals were puppets in the hands of either Iranis or Turanis, the two major groups of nobles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Describe the three common features of the states like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad.</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>What common features were shared by these three states&mdash;Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad?&nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The common features shared by these states were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Though many of the larger states were established by erestwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular, the jagirdari system.</li>\n\t<li>Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all the three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue.</li>\n\t<li>The third common feature in these three states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. &nbsp;Give an account of the Maratha expansion occurred between 1720 and 1761.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; The Maratha empire expanded between 1720 and 1761. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula.<br />\nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly &mdash; into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north, into Bengal and Orissa in the east, and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south.

[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The running water in the river erodes the landscape. When the river tumbles at steep angle over very hard rocks or down a deep valley side it forms a waterfall. While entering the plain the river twists and turns and forms large bends which are known as meanders. Due to continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander, the ends of the meander loop come closer and closer. In -due course of time the meander loop cuts off from the river and forms a cut-off lake, which is also called ox-bow lake. Sometimes, the river overflows its banks causing flood in the neighbouring areas. As it floods, it deposits layers of fine soil and other material called sediments along its banks. As a result&mdash;fertile floodplain is formed. The raised banks are called levees.<br />\nAs the river approaches the sea, the speed of the flowing water decreases and the river begins to break up into several streams known as distributaries. Then a time comes when the river becomes very slow and it begins to deposit its load. Each distributary forms its own mouth. The collection of sediments from all the mouths forms a delta, which is a triangular landmass.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question &nbsp;2. Give an account of the work of wind. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Wind is an active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts. In deserts we often notice rocks in the shape of a mushroom, known as mushroom rocks. Winds erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper part. Therefore, such rocks have narrower base and wider top. When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand from one place to another. When the wind stops blowing the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill-like structures. These are called sand dunes. When the grains are very fine and light, the wind can carry it over long distances. When such sand is deposited in large area, it is called loess.</p>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - Geography - VII", "4.

What is the result if this balance is disturbed? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Green plants use carbon dioxide to make their food and release oxygen. Humans or animals release carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide released by humans or animals seems to be equal to the amount used by the plants which make a perfect balance. But this balance is disturbed by burning of fuels, which add billions of tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Why is temperature in cities much higher than that of villages ?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> In cities we find high rise buildings. The concrete and metals in these buildings and the asaphalt of roads get heated up during the day. This heat is released during the night.<br />\nAnother reason is that the crowded high rise buildings of the cities trap the warm air and thus raise the temperature of the cities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Write a short note on the distribution of air pressure in atmosphere. [Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Air pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of air on the earth&rsquo;s surface. As we go up the layers of atmosphere, the pressure falls rapidly. The air pressure is highest at the sea level and decreases with height. Horizonally the distribution of air pressure is influenced by temperature of air at a given place. In areas where temperature is high the air gets heated and rises. This creates a low pressure&nbsp;area. In areas having lower temperature, the air is cold, hence, it is heavy. Heavy air sinks and creates a high pressure area.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Why do astronauts wear special protective suits when they go to the moon?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Astronauts wear special protective space suits filled with air when they go to the moon.

An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean water. As a result tsunami occurs which may be as high as 15 m. The tsunami of 2004 is still in our mind. It caused huge death and destruction in the coastal areas of India. The Indira point in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands got submerged after the tsunami.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Write a note on the importance of water. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Water is life. Without water, we can not think of life. Its scarcity may create numerous problems but its absence would definitely lead to non-existence of all the living beings on the earth. It is a precious resource of the nature. We drink water whenever we feel thirsty. We use water in numerous activities such as washing clothes, cleaning house floors, watering garden etc. Industries also need water for their functioning. Thus, water is very essential and therefore we must conserve it. Our careless use of water has created several problems. Whatever water is there, it is not of good quality. We should think about the ways of its conservation for our own sake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Explain water cycle with a neat and labelled diagram. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The sun&rsquo;s heat causes evaporation of water, flowing down to stream or drains into water vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses and forms clouds. These clouds, when become too heavy to float, start falling on the land or sea in the form of rain, snow or sleet. Thus, the process by which water continuously changes its form and circulates between oceans, atmosphere and land is known as the water cycle.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/4c729ed0-c432-43fb-88cc-d439a764e65a_Water-2.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n" ], [ "VII", "Social Science - VII", "NCERT Solutions - Geography - VII", "5.

It is high tide when water covers much of the shore by rising to its highest level. It is low tide when water falls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore. Tides are caused due to the strong gravitational pull exerted by the sun and moon on the earth&rsquo;s surface. High tides help in navigation and fishing.

Mention the climate of this Basin.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin lies in the sub-tropical region that is situated between 10&deg;N to 30&deg;N latitudes. The tributaries of river Ganga such as the Ghaghra, the son, the Chambal, the Gandak, the Kosi and the tributaries of Brahmaputra drain it.</p>\n\n<p>The area of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin is dominated by monsoon climate. The monsoon brings rains from mid-June to mid-September. The summers are hot and the winters are cool.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. The Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin has varied topography. How does it affect the distribution of population there?&nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The basin area has varied topography. As a result, the distribution of population is not even everywhere in the area. The mountain areas with steep slopes have inhospitable terrain. Therefore less number of people live in the mountain area of the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin. The plain area provides the most suitable land for human habitation. Therefore, the density of population of the plains is very high.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What is the main activity of the people of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin? Give an account of it.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The main activity of the people of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin is agriculture. Paddy is the main crop here. Other crops grown here are wheat, maize, sorgham gram and millets. Cash crops like sugarcane and jute are also grown. Banana plantations are seen in some areas in the plain. In the West Bengal and Assam tea is grown in plantations. Silk is produced through the cultivation of silk worms in parts of Bihar and Assam. In the mountains and hills, where the slopes are gentle crops are grown on terraces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. How can you say that the life of the people of the Amazon basin is changing? [Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Time is moving ahead very fast. This has resulted in the change of the life style of the people everywhere. The life of the people of the Amazon basin is also changing, though not at fast speed. In the old days it was difficult to reach the heart of the forest. In 1970 the Trans Amazon highway made all parts of the rain forest accessible. Aircrafts and helicopters are also used for reaching various places.

Why does a burning candle go out when you blow on it?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer: </strong>When we blow on candle, the hot air around the candle gets removed and it brings down the temperature of candle below the flash point. Thus, a candle goes out because no fuel can burn below its flash point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Spraying water is not a good way of putting out an oil fire or an electrical fire. Why not?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Spraying water is not a good way of putting out an oil fire or an electrical fire. If water is sprayed onto an oil fire, the oil will float to the top of the water and continue to burn. This can be very dangerous because water can flow quickly carrying the burning oil with it and spreading the fire.

Was it the right decision? Give reasons for your Answer.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> I think it was the right decision because no one can imagine life in someone&#39;s captivity. Freedom is more valuable thing than life. Chandni could have gone back to her small hut of Abbu and saved her life but she chooses to fight with the wolf instead to gain her freedom. She didn&#39;t died coward. She fought with courage show the picture of bravery to attain freedom of her life. She might have lived longer in the captivity but she died everyday in the imprisonment. She fought with the wolf and told herself that success or failure is a matter of luck or chance. So, she took the right decision afterall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Freedom is life.

Although, bears are able to kill a person easily. He &nbsp;opened his mouth several times as if he wanted to say something and looked at her with his cunning eyes which seems that he was not afraid of her at all but wanted to be loved by her.
