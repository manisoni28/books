Now put the test tube in a beaker having water. Heat the beaker till all the green colour from the leaf comes out into the spirit in the test tube. Take out the leaf and wash it with water. Put it on a plate and pour some iodine solution over it. The iodine solution is brown in colour but when it comes in contact with starch it turns blue-black. The iodine solution will turn blue-black when dropped on the leaf, this confirms the presence of starch in the leaf.<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/54cfc1c7-b2cb-4314-8872-4e531f0cfd8b_Getting-to-Know-Plants-16.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Explain that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis.</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Take a potted plant having green leaves. Place it in a dark room for a day or two so that all the starch present in leaves is used by the plant. Now cover a portion of leaf with black paper and keep the plant in the sun for a day. Pluck the leaf, remove the black paper and test it for the starch. We see that only that part of the leaf becomes blue-black which was open to sun. The covered part does not become blue-black. This shows that no starch is formed because it gets no sunlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

What happens if the percentage of carbon-dioxide increases in the air?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The increased percentage of carbon-dioxide will cause green house effect, i.e. it will not allow the hot rays of sun to escape from the atmosphere after reflection once they enter the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, thereby increasing the temperature of earth, ice on mountains will melt and water level will rise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. You must have seen during rainy season, when it rains the animals like earthworm, snakes, snails etc. are commonly seen. Explain why?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;All these animals live in underground burrows or remain buried in the soil. They get oxygen from air that enters into the burrow through entrance of burrow or through pores in the soil. But when it rains, the water gets filled in their dwelling places and pores of the soil. So, they come out in search of air.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Why is carbon-dioxide gas used to extinguish fire?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;It is because carbon-dioxide does not support combustion. When sprayed on burning object it stops the supply of oxygen and extinguishes fire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12.

India&rsquo;s diversity has always been recognised as a source of its strength Explain.</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;It is a fact that India&rsquo;s diversity has always been recognised as a source of its strength. It became clear when the country was struggling against the British rule. People from different cultural, religious and regional backgrounds came forward together to oppose the British government in India. They worked together to decide joint actions, they went to jail together and they found different ways to oppose the British. The British thought that they could divide Indians because they were so different and then continue to rule them. But it was their illusion. Although Indians were so different, they were united from within at the question of the British government in India. They were &lsquo;one&rsquo; in their battle against the British.

It was the geography of Kerala which made the possibility of spice cultivation there. So far Ladakh in concerned, its special geographical location flourished the business of wool collection among the Ladakhi people. The people of Ladakh carefully collect the wool of the sheep and sell it to the traders from Kashmir. The history of both the regions has been affected with similar cultural influences. Both the regions were influenced by Chinese and Arab traders. Thus, we can say the history and geography are often tied in the cultural life of a region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.

We know how to behave with other people belonging to different caste, creed or culture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>III. LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. How do we explain diversity? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Diversity is the term that applies to dissimilarities. It may be in language, food, culture, living, religion, etc. India is a unique country where one can observe it extensively. There are a number of festivals, languages, dresses, religions, etc. in India. Still people of India are Indians and they salute the one flag and sing one national anthem. It is unity in diversity.<br />\nDiversity occurs when we travel to different parts of the world. Since time immemorial people have been visiting different lands in order to learn something and for trade. They adopted different styles, languages and cultures from all those places.<br />\nDiversity also occurs due to geographical variations and natural calamities. For example, Kashmir is a cold place and the temperature goes even below 0&deg;C. Naturally Kashmiri people wear woolen clothes, eat and drink hot food. On the other hand, people in desert areas use different clothes because it is veiy hot there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;2.

Veiy little agriculture is possible here. It is therefore people here keep sheep, goats, cows and dzos for their living. They eat meat and milk products like cheese and butter. Kerala is a coastal region. The fertile land and climate are suited to growing rice and a majority of people here eat rice, fish and vegetables.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The clothes they wear.</strong>&nbsp;Ladakhi people wear woollen clothes including pashmina shawls because it is very cold there. The people of Kerala wear cotton clothes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The work they do.</strong>&nbsp;The people of Ladakh rear sheep for its wool. They carefully collect the wool of the sheep and sell this to traders from Kashmir. The main occupations of the people of Kerala are fishing and farming. People grow rice in huge quantity. They also grow a number of spices like pepper, cloves and cardamoms. It is spices that made this region an attractive place for traders.</li>\n</ul>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "2.

Even today their condition has not changed. Whether it is home or outside, they are not given due opportunity. The mental set-up of the parents is such that it never accepts the birth of a daughter wholeheartedly. As a result girls&rsquo; life is badly affected. Here is the list of five different effects that this stereotype can have on the way daughters get treated.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Girls would feel discouraged and they would not concentrate to their studies.</li>\n\t<li>All their dreams to achieve separate identity in the society would be shattered.</li>\n\t<li>Sometimes girls are not allowed to join any school or college. This ruthless altitude of the parents towards their daughters ruin their career. They feel helpless even in their parents&rsquo; house.</li>\n\t<li>Even marriage does not bring fortune to the girls all the time. Some in-laws prove themselves good by giving proper treatment to the newly married girls. But most of the time we find that they are ill-treated in their in-laws&rsquo; house. They are subject to exploitation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. What does the Constitution say with regard to equality? Why do you think it is important for all people to be equal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Our Constitution provides that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or region.<br />\nIt is important for all people to be equal because only then our society would develop in true sense of the term. It is our right to be treated equally. It is our right to be given due respect. It is our right to be given equal opportunities. In absence of all these, our life would be hell. Our personality would be suppressed. Hence, we need equality so that we may go ahead without any hindrances. We may prove ourselves helpful in the development of the society and country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Sometimes people make prejudiced comments in our presence.

Hence, he should not tease his classmate. Instead, he should take care of his dignity and self-respect.<br />\n(b) I would stop him/her to do that.<br />\n(c) I would advise my classmates to be friendly with one and all.<br />\n(d) I would not get involved in the joke and would proceed from their immediately<br />\n(e) I would try to convince those boys that girls are in no way less efficient than their male counterparts.

Differentiate between inequality and discrimination. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Inequality and discrimination are the two different concepts. But they are related closely to each other. Inequality may be the difference between caste, creed, culture, language, region, economic status, educational background, etc. Everyone differs from the other in society. Discrimination takes place when one acts against an individual or a community on the basis of difference. A whim or a prejudice works behind it. If one tries to exploit the other&#39; individual who is down in status<br />\nin any way it is called discrimination. That discriminated individual or community is devoid of the common opportunity or facility provided by the society. It is not at all healthy for a good society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What are the Constitutional provisions for establishing equality in Indian society? Do you think these are enough? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Right from the beginning of the social set-up, India has been a victim of inequality and discrimination. Society was divided into four main castes. All the opportunities were confined to the upper class. Some of the castes were considered so low that people even scared from their shadow. It created great disparity in society. With the spread of education a consciousness against this evil system was aroused. After getting independence the Constitution makers had strong arguments against this system. So, it was declared a crime in our Constitution. It was declared that the Constitution would provide equality and right against discrimination to the citizens of India. Reservation was provided for those discriminated people in every field of life.<br />\nBut still it is a fact the system persists. Only Constitutional provisions are not enough. It is observed that even after reservation, these people lay behind. They prefer earning their livelihood than going to school. A compulsory educational system should be developed. A mass consciousness is needed otherwise, we can&rsquo;t hope more.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "3.

What did it accomplish?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The movement for voting rights to women came to be known as the suffrage movement. All over Europe and USA, women and the poor have had to fight for participation in the government. Women&rsquo;s struggle to vote got strengthened during the first world war. During the War, many men were away fighting and because of this women were called upon to do work that was earlier considered men&rsquo;s work. Thus, women got opportunity to show their capability. People as a whole got disillusioned. They began demanding the right to vote for all women. The result was positive. American women got the right to vote in 1920 while women in the UK got the right to vote on the same terms as men some years later, in 1928.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The government has a variety of works to do. To discharge each and every responsibility smoothly, it works at three different levels, at the local level, at the level of the state and at the national level. The local level means in your village, town or locality. The state level would mean the entire state and the national level relates to the entire country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How is democracy different from monarchy?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for the people.

The government has to explain its actions and defend its decisions to the people.<br />\nIn a monarchy, it is the King or queen who has the power to make decisions and run the government.

For example, there is a law that says that all persons driving a two-wheeler must wear helmet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. What was the voting system in India before Independence? What ideas did Gandhiji express in the journal Young India about voting system? &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;In India, before Independence, only a small minority enjoyed the voting right. This was shocking for Gandhiji. He firmly disapproved this system and advocated for universal adult franchise which gives all adults the right to vote.<br />\nExpressing his ideas in the journal Young India in 1931 Gandhiji said that it is discriminating to deprive poor and illiterate people of voting rights. Snatching the right to vote from a person simply because he is poor or illiterate is in no way justified. A poor or illiterate is also a citizen of the country and he has every right to enjoy all privileges existing in the country. Thus, Gandhiji was very much fair and favoured the system that would provide equal voting right to all.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "4.

These representatives take decisions on behalf of the people.</li>\n\t<li>People participate in the process of government by taking an interest in the working of the government and by criticising it when required.</li>\n\t<li>People express their views through several ways and make governments understand what actions they should take. They stage dhamas, hold rallies, strikes, signature campaigns, etc.</li>\n\t<li>Another ways for people to participate is by organising themselves into social movements that seek to challenge the government and its functioning. Members of the minority community can participate in this manner.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Why do you think we need the government to find solutions to many disputes or conflicts?<br />\nAns:</strong>&nbsp; Government is a constitutional body that maintains law and order. It consists of the representatives of all classes from all parts of the country. Problems or conflicts arise in states, between two or more states and sometimes between two nations. The government represents the country and also the head of the constitutional system. So, it can resolve conflicts in the interest of the people at large. A system without a government may face crisis and lawlessness. Hence, government is necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What actions does the government take to ensure that all people are treated equally?<br />\nAns:</strong>&nbsp;The government ensures that the constitutional provisions are implied in the country. It makes laws and enforces them to abolish all sorts of discriminations. It makes provisions to provide equal facilities to all classes of people, promotion of education among girls and economically backwards. These are some of the actions that the government takes to ensure equality among people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Read through the chapter and discuss some of the key ideas of a democratic government.

Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp;Rivers can also become a source of conflict between states. A river may begin in one state, Flow through another and end in a third. The sharing of river water between different states that the river goes through is becoming an issue of conflict. We can cite an example of Cauveiy water dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The water stored In Krishnasagar dam in Karnataka is used for irrigating a number of districts and for meeting the needs of the city of Bangalore. The water stored in Methur dam in Tamil Nadu is used for crops grown in the delta region of that state.<br />\nA conflict arises because both dams Eire on the same river. The downstream dam in Tamil Nadu can only be filled up if water is released from the upstream one located in Karnataka. Therefore, both states can&rsquo;t get as much water as they need for people in their states. This leads to conflict. Now, it is the job of central government to step in and see that a fair distribution is worked out for both states.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "5.

How does the Municipal Corporation earn the money to do its work?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The Municipal Corporation is one of the most important organs of the three-tier government system. It is responsible for all round development of its designated area. It undertakes all the public facilities and welfare works like sanitation, water, road, education, health, etc. As these works require fund, so it collects revenue from the residents living in its corporation area. It levies taxes on property, water and other services. Taxes are fixed on the measurement and consumption of the services.

Children are so close to open garbage that they may fall sick or they may develop symptoms of some deadly disease in the long run. There may be pieces of broken glasses. While collecting garbage in,this manner, their fingers may get injured. We see two stray cows around the garbage searching some eatables. These cows may attack these boys which may take their lives. Thus, there is no safety at all in this way.<br />\n(iii) The proper ways of disposing garbage are not available to those who work in municipalities because firstly, the government has not done proper arrangement for this as yet. It has provided trucks no doubt but their number is not sufficient. Secondly, the workers working in the municipalities are generally less aware of health and hygeine. They do not bother whether garbage is being disposed properly or not. Thirdly, the economic condition of the municipalities is not good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Several poor people in the city work as domestic servants as well as work for the Corporation, keeping the city clean. Yet the slums in which they live are quite filthy. This is because these slums seldom have any water and sanitation facilities. The reason often given by the Municipal Corporation is that the land in which the poor have set up their homes does not belong to them and that slum-dwellers do not pay taxes. However, people living in middle class neighbourhoods pay very little in taxes compared to the amount of money the corporation spends on them in setting up parks, street lighting facilities, regular garbage collection etc. Also as you read in this chapter, the property taxes collected by the Municipality makes up only 25-30 percent of its money. Why do you not think it is important that the Corporation should spend more money on slum localities? Why is it important that the Municipal Corporation provide the poor in the city with the same facilities that the rich get?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp;I think it is important that the corporation should spend more money on slum localities because slum-dwellers are also a part of our society. They need education, sanitation, rehabilitation and other facilities as the common people avail. They are also human beings. They lack even basic amenities of life which cause spread of many diseases among them. They are the citizens of our country. So in order to achieve our constitutional ideals the Municipal Corporation should provide the poor in the city with the same facilities that the rich get.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "7.

LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Write a short note on the lives of fishing families. [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Fishing families usually live close to the sea. Their lives revolve around the sea and fish. One can find rows of catamarans and nets lying around their houses. Their day usually starts from 7 O&rsquo;clock in the morning. This is the time when there is a lot of activity on the beach. After catching fish the fishermen return with their catamarans. Women then gather to buy and sell fish.They do not go to the sea for at least four months during the monsoon because this is when the fish breed.&nbsp;During these months they survive by borrowing from the trader. And thus, they are forced to sell the fish to that trader later on.The lives of fisherfolk are full of risks. Whenever there is a storm, they have to suffer a lot. In 2004, the tsunami hit them badly. They were the worst sufferers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What different activities are done by the people of Kalpattu village?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Kalpattu is coastal village in Tamil Nadu. As the village is surrounded by low hills, paddy is the main crop here. Most of the families earn a living through agriculture. Besides agriculture, people do many non-farm activities such as making baskets, utensils, pots, bricks, bullock carts, etc.&nbsp;The village has no dearth of service providers like blacksmiths, nurses, teachers, washermen, weavers, barbers, cycle repair mechanics and so on. One can find here shopkeepers and traders too. There is a bazaar where a variety of small shops such as tea shops, grocery shops, a tailor, seed shop etc. can be found. There are some coconut groves around the village. A group of people earn their living by working in mango orchards. In the village, there are small farmers as well as big farmers. There are landless labourers too who work in other&rsquo;s field.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Under which circumstances poor farmers find themselves unable to pay back their loans? What happens after that?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Poor farmers are bound to take loans for agriculture purpose. Sometimes they successfully pay back the loans but there are also moments when they fail to do that in time because of crop failure. This is a very tough time for them. For the family to survive, they have to borrow more money. Soon the loan becomes so large that no matter what they earn, they are unable to repay.&nbsp;This is when we can say they are caught in debt. Whenever this situation occurs, farmers become helpless. Their helplessness to repay the loan sometimes compel them to commit suicide.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Civics - VI", "9.

Short Answer Type Questions&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>1. How were stone tools used in the past? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Some stone tools were used to cut meat and bone, scrape bark from trees and hides le. animal skins, chop fruit and roots. Some were used as handles of bone or wood. Some were used to make spears and arrows for hunting. Other tools were used to cut wood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What do you know about habitation-cum-factory sites?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Usually, we find blocks of stone, tools that were made and perhaps discarded because they were not perfect, and chips of waste stone left behind at factory sites. Sometimes, people lived here for longer period of time. These sites are called habitation-cum-factory sites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Mention the two techniques that were used to make stone tools.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The two techniques of making stone tools were:<br />\n(i) Stone on stone technique. In this technique the pebble from which the tool was to be made was held in one hand. Another stone, which was used as a hammer was held in the other hand. The second stone was used to strike off flakes from the first, till the required shape was obtained.<br />\n(ii) Pressure flaking. In this technique, the pebble or core was placed on a firm surface. The hammer stone was used on a piece of bone or stone that was placed on the core, to remove flakes that could be shaped into tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What do you know about the work division among men and women in the ancient past? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;It is totally difficult to know about it. However, we can mention atleast two possibilities which are:<br />\n(i) It is likely that both men and women may have done many of the work like hunting, gathering plant produce, etc. together.<br />\n(ii) It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the sub-continent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VII.Long Answer Type Questions</strong><br />\n<strong>1. What were the various reasons for hunter-gatherers to move from place to place? Mention in detail.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Hunter-gatherers kept on moving from one place to another for the following reasons:<br />\n(i) Staying at one place for a long time would have ended up the availability of plant and animal resources.<br />\n(ii) Animals move from place to place&mdash;either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why, those who hunted them had to follow their movements.<br />\n(iii) Plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. Hence, people may have moved from season to season in the hope of getting different kinds of fruits, (iu) Plants, animals and plants need water for their survival. While many rivers and lakes are perennial others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons, le. winter and summer.<br />\n(iv) People may have travelled to meet their kith and kin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What was the impact of the change in environment around 12,000 years ago? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Major changes in the climate of the world with a shift to relatively warm conditions were noticed around 12,000 years ago. As a result, grasslands developed in many regions. This resulted in the increase in the herbivorous animals like deer, antelope, goat, sheep and cattle. This encouraged people to herd and rear these animals. They also engaged themselves in fishing.<br />\nSeveral grain bearing grasses such as wheat, barley and rice also grew around this time in different parts of the sub-continent. Men, women and children began to collect these grains to use them as their food. By the time, they also learnt where these grains grew and when they ripened.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - History - VI", "3.

Describe tools used by farmers and herders. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Stone tools have been found from many sites. They are often different from the Palaeolithic tools and are called &lsquo;Neolithic&rsquo;. There were tools that were polished so as to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles were used for grinding grain and other plant produce. However, Palaeolithic tools were still used for some purposes. Some tools were also made of bone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VII. Long Answer Type Questions</strong><br />\n<strong>1. How did the changing climate affect the life of humans? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The climate of the world had major changes around 12,000 years ago. There was a shift to relatively warm conditions. Grasslands developed in many areas. Plants and animals also developed in the meantime. Humans observed the places where edible plants were found, they wondered how seed broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. They became farmers due to these changes.<br />\nThey also learnt how to get the attention of animals by taming them and proriding them food. People tamed the wild ancestor of the dog. They also started rearing sheep, goat, cattle, etc. and this made them herders. Grasslands had allowed many animals which lived on grass to grow in number.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Describe the site of Mehrgarh.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Mehrgarh is a site located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, one of the most important routes into Iran.

What was an important features of capital cities of &lsquo;mahqjanapadas&rsquo;? Why were they fortified? How were they fortified?&nbsp; [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Capital cities of &lsquo;mahajanapadas&rsquo; were mostly fortified by building huge walls of wood, brick or stone around them. There were various reasons for building forts. They were probably built because people were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed protection. Some rulers probably built forts to make their cities impressive and to show how rich and powerful they were. Moreover, by making forts, controlling the fortified area became easier for the kings. Buildings forts required a great-deal of planning. Hundreds of thousands of brick or stone had to be prepared. Enormous amount of labour and resources were required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.

Heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better with an iron ploughshare than with a wooden ploughshare.<br />\n(ii) People began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. Production developed due to this since many plants survived.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VIII. MAP SKILLS</strong><br />\n<strong>1.

Why did it become more popular? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Bhakti movement was a new way of worship. Bhakti means devotion to a particular deity. During the post vedic era some deities like Shiva, Vishnu and Durga became popular among the devotees. This inclination towards deities came to be known as Bhakti movement.It became popular because in this, there was no discrimination among the worshippers or devotees.

The monkey king like the other kings has a huge army. He himself is wise, diplomatic and brave. He has the virtue of taking right moment. When he observes the situation of the attack on his community by the king&rsquo;s men, he makes a quick plan to save his army. First, he let all of them cross the river.

Find out more and teU. a story from one of the epics.<br />\nAns:</strong>&nbsp;We have a number of stories in our epics which inspire us in many ways. They guide us and teach us the ideals of life. Such epics are the Mahabharata and Ramayana. In the Mahabharata, we have one such story. The battle was finalised between Kauravas and Pandavas. Both the parties were making efforts&#39; to win the favour of their relatives and other king. Krishna who was related to both was considered as a super man, possessing the qualities of gods. So, Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas approached him. On the same day Arjuna, one of the five Pandavas, also went to Krishna. Duryodhana was a proud fellow. He sat on the head-side of Krishna who was sleeping at that time. Arjuna, a humble fellow, reached there after Duryodhana. But he sat at the feet side of Krishna and began pressing his feet. As Krishna opened his eyes, he saw Aijuna. Krishna had already promised them that he would be from the side of the man who would reach him first. As krishna saw Arjuna first he said that he would be in favour of Arjuna. Duryodhana opposed it because he had reached there first. Krishna said that those who want to get something from anyone then should be humble and courteous. Here, Duryodhana lost Krishna.

Entrance to the path was through gateways.</li>\n\t<li>Devotees walked around the stupa in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Describe the earliest Hindu temples.</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Some Hindu temples were also built during this period. The deities worshipped in these shrines were Vishnu, Shiva and Durga. The most important part of the temples was the garbhagriha, which was a room where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was at this place that priests performed religious rituals and devotees offered worship to the deity. The garbhagriha had a tower known as the shikhara built on its top. This marked the place as a sacred one. Building shikharas require careful planning. Most temples also had a mandapa. This was a hall like structure meant for the common people to assemble. Mahabalipuram and Aihole in south India were famous for their temples. These were stone temples. The monolithic temples of Mahabalipuram were very beautiful. Each of these temples was carved out of a huge, single piece of stone. It is therefore they are known as monoliths. The Durga temple at Aihole was built about 1400 years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Describe the two Sanskrit epics the Mahabharata and Ramayana.</strong><br />\n<strong>Or&nbsp;<strong>Why are the epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana so popular even today?&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Mahabharata and Ramayana are the most popular of the epics and other religious books of the Hindus. They are also famous among the followers of other religion. The causes for their popularity are almost the same. The story of the Mahabharata tells family drama followed by a great war between the two groups of the same family, the Kauravas and Pandavas. Here, we learn how are fights for the right cause. The Pandavas are dethroned and banished diplomatically by their cousin Duryodhana. They are always subjected to humiliation and injustice. Finally, they are put in a great battle to get their own right. In the Mahabharata we know how much tolerance one should have, how one can fight for a justified cause, how we should respect our elders, etc. There are so many teachings of ideal life in it. The Gita, which constitute a part of the Mahabharata is in itself considered as a great epic. It unfolds all the mysteries of life, the life before and the life after.<br />\nIn the same way the Ramayana, written in the most popular language of the time, teaches us the high ideals of life. Rama, the most prominent character, shows how man should follow the ideals of life. He possesses all the virtues of a highly idealistic and realistic human being. He follows the system in a humble way. He fights for the justice and his right. This story is told in a very realistic way. It seems to be the story of a common man. So, it has a great appeal in our society till today.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Geography - VI", "1.

So the heat received is maximum at these latitudes. These latitudes fall under the Torrid Zone.<br />\n(g) India and the United Kingdom lie on different longitudes. Each degree of longitudes corresponds to a difference of four minutes. This is because the earth rotates 360&deg; in 24 hours, 1&deg; in 4 minutes.

TeU. the time in Greenwich when it is shown live on TV there.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;New Zealand lies in time zone +12, Le. it is 12 hours ahead of Greenwich, or Greenwich is 12 hours behind New Zealand. So when it is 10.30 am on January 10 in New Zealand, it is 10.30 pm on January 9. So the cricket match will be telecast from 10.30 pm on Jan 9 in Greenwich.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Why do we have the concept of time zone? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The sun does not shine with the same intensity over all parts of the world at a particular time. If it is overhead at one place (midday), then it does not shine at all (midnight) at the place directly opposite to that place on the earth. So if we have the same time, then 12 noon will mean midday at one place, and midnight at another. To avoid such an awkward system, we have the system of time zones, so that everywhere a particular time means the same stage of the day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Write a short note on Heat Zones. &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Heat zones are the different zones of the earth, where the sun&rsquo;s rays fall differently, thus causing different climate patterns. These zones are called the Torrid Zone, the two Temperate Zones, and the two Frigid Zones. The Torrid Zone is very hot since the sun shines overhead here. The Temperate Zones maintain a moderate climate, and the Frigid Zones are extremely cold.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/883d0cc7-fbca-4ae5-ac39-8e51d8d08bf6_Globe-Latitudes-Longitudes-2.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. How do latitudes and longitudes help in locating a point? Why is only one of them&nbsp;insufficient in doing this? &nbsp;[V.

What would happen if the earth did not rotate? &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In such a condition the portion of the earth facing the sun would always experience day, and thus there would be continuous warmth in the region. At the same time the other half would always remain dark and be freezing cold all the time. These are extreme conditions which are not suitable for life. Thus, we can say that if the earth did not rotate life would not have been possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How does leap year occur? &nbsp;[V.

This surplus day is added to the month of February. Thus every fourth year, February of 29 days instead of 28 days. Such a year with 366 days is called a leap year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.

As the rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer, these areas receive more heat. But the areas size to the poles receive less heat due to the slanting rays of the sun. The North Pole is inclined towards the sun the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months. Since a large area of the Northern Hemisphere is getting light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June. These cAnditions are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere at this time. It is winter season there having longer nights and &nbsp;shorter days. This position of the earth is known as the summer solstice.<br />\n<strong>(b) Winter solstice.</strong> On 22nd December, the Tropic of Capricorn receives direct rays of the sun as the South Pole tilts towards it. As the sun&rsquo;s rays fall vertically at the Tropic of Capricorn, a larger portion of the Southern Hemisphere gets light. Hence, the Southern Hemisphere enjoys summer having longer days and shorter nights. This position of the earth is called the winter solstice.<br />\n<strong>(c) </strong>On 21st March and 23rd September direct rays of the sun fall on the equator. At this position, neither of the poles is tilted towards the sun. As result, the entire earth experiences equal days and equal nights. This phenomenon is known as an equinox.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Geography - VI", "4. Maps", "Maps 1", 1, "<p><strong>1.

Long Answer Type Questions</strong><br />\n<strong>1. Define and discuss &lsquo;distance&rsquo; as a component of a map. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Maps are drawings. They reduce the whole world or a part of it to fit on a sheet of paper. In other words we can say that maps are drawn to reduced scales. But it needs great care while doing this reduction work in order to keep the distance between the real places. It can only be possible when a small distance on paper represents a large distance on the ground. For this purpose a scale is used. Scale is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map. We can understand this with the help of an example. Suppose, the distance between your coaching centre and your school is 8 km. If you show this 8 km distance by 2 cm on a map. It means, 1 cm on the map will show 4 km on the ground.<br />\nThus, the scale of your drawing will be &nbsp;1 cm = 4 km<br />\nScale is very important in any map. If scale is known, calculation of distance between any two places on a map will be easy.<br />\nA small scale is used to show large areas on a paper like continents or countries. For example, 10 cm on the map shows 1000 km of the ground.<br />\nA large scale is used to show a small area like a village or town on paper. For example, 10 cm on the map shows 1000 metres only on the ground.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Give an account of &lsquo;direction&rsquo; as a major component of a map. &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Direction is an important component of a map. Most maps contain an arrow marked with the letter &lsquo;N&rsquo; at the upper right hand comer. This arrow show the north direction. It is called the north line. After knowing the north direction, other directions, east, west and south can be easily found out.<br />\nThere are four major directions&mdash;North, South, East and West. They are called cardinal points. Besides these, there are four intermediate directions. They are north-east (NE), south-east (SE), south-west (SW) and north-west (NW). Location of any place with more accuracy can be possible with the help of these intermediate directions.<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2f5c3814-8fdd-48af-8d17-4a30deb8f1d1_Maps-5.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Discuss symbols as a major component of a map. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Drawing different features such as buildings, roads, etc. in their actual shape and size on a map is perhaps not possible. It is therefore, they are shown by using certain letters, shades, colours, pictures and lines. These are symbols that give a lot of information is a limited space. With the use of these symbols, maps can be drawn easily and are simple to read. These symbols help us greatly in a situation when we don&rsquo;t know the language of an area and therefore cannot ask someone for directions. We can collect information from maps with the help of these symbols.<br />\nMaps have a universal language, known and understood by all.

Short Answer Type Questions&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>1. Mention the three main components of the environment. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The three main components of the environment are - the lithosphere, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. The lithosphere is the solid portion of the earth. The gaseous layers that surround the earth is the atmosphere. The atmosphere is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, carbondioxide and other gases. The hydrosphere refers to the big area of water that covers the earth&rsquo;s surface. This water is in the forms of ice, water and water vapour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Write a short note on the &lsquo;hydrosphere&rsquo;.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The hydrosphere refers to the water bodies that are found on the earth&rsquo;s surface. More than 71% of the earth is covered with water. This water is found in all its forms&mdash;ice, water and water vapour. Running water in oceans and rivers and in lakes, ice in glaciers, underground water and the water vapour in atmosphere. More than 97% of the earth&rsquo;s water is found in oceans. The ocean water is very salty, hence not of human utility. A large proportion of the rest of water is in the form of the icesheets and glaciers or under the ground. A very small percentage (0.03%) is available as fresh water. It is this water that we use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Explain biosphere&mdash;the domain of life. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The biosphere is a narrow zone of the earth where land, water and air interact with each other to support life. It is in this zone that life exists. There are several species of organisms that vary in size from microbes and bacteria to large mammals. All living organisms including humans are linked to each other and to the biosphere for survival.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Give an account of the composition of atmosphere. Also discuss the importance of the components. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen, and oxygen. Together they make up about 99% of clean, dry air. Nitrogen 78% and oxygen 21%. Apart from these two major gases, there are other gases too in the atmosphere. These gases include carbon dioxide, argon and others comprise 1% by volume. &lsquo;<br />\nOxygen is the breath of life while nitrogen helps in the growth of living organisms. Carbon dioxide absorbs heat radiated by the earth. In this way, it keeps the planet warm. It is also essential for the growth of plants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What is atmosphere? Write about its different layers.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The atmosphere is a thin blanket of air that surrounds the earth. It provides us with the air we breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of sun&rsquo;s rays. The atmosphere extends upto a height of about 1,600 km. The atmosphere is divided into five layers based on composition, temperature and other properties. These layers are&mdash;the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the themosphere and the exosphere.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Social Science - VI", "NCERT Solutions - Geography - VI", "5.

Long Answer Type Questions</strong><br />\n<strong>1. What are the major landforms? Write about them in brief. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The major landforms are mountains, plateaus and plains.<br />\n<strong>1. Mountains:&nbsp;</strong>They are natural elevation of the earth surface. They are higher than the surrounding area. Some mountains are veiy high. They are even higher than the clouds. Some mountains have permanently frozen rivers of ice known as glaciers. Mountains are generally thinly populated regions because the climate is harsh there. Farming is also not easily possible there. But mountains provide us water. They have a rich variety of flora and fauna.<br />\n<strong>2. Plateaus:&nbsp;</strong>They are usually flat-topped table land and are higher than the surrounding area. Plateaus may be young or old. The Deccan plateau in India is one of the oldest plateaus. Plateaus are very useful for mankind. They have rich deposits of minerals such as diamond, gold, iron, manganese etc. Several water falls can be found in the plateau regions.<br />\n<strong>3. Plains:&nbsp;</strong>They are vast stretches of flat land. They are mostly formed by rivers and their tributaries. Plains are usually fertile lands. Hence, thick population is found there. Construction of transport network is easy. Cultivation is also easy. Plains also provide level land for the construction of houses or buildings. In India, the Indo-Gangetic plains are the regions where one can find great concentration of population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How many types of mountains are there?

Short Answer Type Questions&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Explain cold weather season and hot weather season.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;During cold weather season (winter), the sunrays do not fall directly in the region. As a result the temperatures are quite low in northern India. In hot weather season (summer), the sunrays fall directly in the region. Hence, temperature becomes very high. Hot and diy winds called loo blow during the day time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Why do we experience regional differences in the climate of India? Explain with examples. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; We experience regional differences in the climate of India due to these factors&mdash; location of a place, altitude, distance from the sea and relief. For examples, Jaisalmer and Bikaner in the desert of Rajasthan are very hot while Drass and Kargil in Jammu and Kashmir are very cold. Coastal places like Mumbai and&nbsp;Kolkata experience moderate climate. It means these places are neither very hot nor very cold. Mawsynram in Meghalaya receives the world&rsquo;s highest rainfall, while Jaisalmer receives least rainfall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Mention the periods of various seasons of India. &nbsp;[Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n(i) Cold weather season, i.e. winter remains from December to February.<br />\n(ii) Hot weather season, summer ranges from March to May.<br />\n(iii) Southwest monsoon season, Le. rainy season remains from June to September.<br />\n(iv) Season of retreating monsoon, Le. autumn occurs in the month October and lasts upto the month of November.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Mention the main features of thorny bushes.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n(i) Thorny bushes are found in dry areas of the country.<br />\n(ii) The leaves are in the form of spines to reduce the loss of water.<br />\n(iii) Cactus, khair, babool, keekar are important thorny bushes.<br />\n(iv) They are found in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Eastern slopes of Western Ghats and Gujarat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Write a note on mountain vegetation.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Mountains are homes of various species of trees. They are found according to the variation in height. With increase in height, the temperature falls. At a height between 1500 metres and 2500 metres most of the trees are conical in shape. Such trees are called coniferous trees. Mountain vegetation includes trees such as chir, pine and deodar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How are forests important for us? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Forests play a vital role in the life of the human beings and in their absence we can&rsquo;t imagine life. Plants release oxygen that we breathe and absorb carbon dioxide. The roots of the plants bind the soil and in this way check soil erosion. We get several things from the forests, such as wood for furniture, fuel, fodder, medicinal herbs, honey, lac, gum, fruits etc.Forests provide natural habitat to the wildlife, such as lions, tigers, elephants, monkeys, etc.As forests are so beneficial for us, we must make efforts to conserve it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. What should we do to conserve wildlife? &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>We must not involve in hunting and poaching of wild animals. We can refuse to buy things made from parts of the bodies of animals such as their bones, horns, fur, skins and feathers. It will be an effective way to conserve wildlife. We should participate in the wildlife week which falls in the first week of October and try to create awareness of conserving the habitats of the animal kingdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VII. Long Answer Type Questions</strong><br />\n<strong>1. Explain different types of seasons found in India</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Four major seasons are found in India:<br />\n<strong>(i) Cold Weather Season (Winter):</strong>&nbsp;This season occurs in the month of December and lasts upto the month of February. During this season temperature remains cold in the northern India because the sunrays do not fall directly in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>(ii) Hot weather season (Summer):</strong>&nbsp;This season starts in the month of March and ends in the month of May. During this season temperature becomes very hot because the sunrays fall directly in the region. Hot and dry winds called loo blow during the day time.<br />\n<strong>(iii) South West monsoon season (Rainy season);</strong>&nbsp;This season is marked by the advent and advance of monsoon. The winds blow from Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal towards the land. They carry moisture with them. When these winds strike the mountain barriers it begins raining.<br />\n<strong>(iv) Season of retreating monsoon (Autumn):</strong>&nbsp;This is the season of retreating monsoons. During this season winds move back from the mainland to the Bay of Bengal. The southern parts of India receive rainfall in this season.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Mention different types of vegetation found in India. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Five different types of vegetation is found in India:<br />\n(i) Tropical rain forests. These forests are found in the areas which receive heavy rainfall. They are very dense and sunlight never reach the ground. The trees of these forests shed their leaves at different times of the year. Therefore, they always appear green are called evergreen forests. Important trees of these forests are mahogany, ebony and rosewood. They are found in Andaman and Nicobar islands, parts of North-Eastern states and a narrow strip of the western slope of the Western Ghats.<br />\n(ii) Tropical deciduous forests. These forests are also known as monsoon forests and are found in a large part of the country. They are less dense. They shed their leaves at a particular time of the year. Sal, teak, neem, peepal and shisham are important trees found in these forests. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa etc. are home of these forests.<br />\n(iii) Thorny bushes. They are found in the dry areas. Cactus, khair, babool and Keekar are important thorny bushes. They are found in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, etc.<br />\n(iv) Mountain Vegetation. A variety of trees are found in the mountains. They are conical in shape. Hence trees are called conical trees. Chir, pine and deodar are important trees of these forests.<br />\n(v) Mangrove Forests. These forests grow in saline water. They are found in Sundarbans in west Bengal and in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Sundari is a well-known species of trees in mangrove-forests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Describe the wildlife of India. &nbsp;[V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Forests are home to wildlife, which include several species of animals and a variety of reptiles, amphibians, mammals, birds, insects and worms.<br />\nThe tiger, our national animal, is found ip various parts of the country. Gir forest in Gujarat is the home of Asiatic lions. Elephants and one-homed rhinoceroses are found in the forests of Assam. Elephants are found in Kerala and Karnataka. Camels and wild asses are found in the Great Indian desert and the Rann of Kuchchh respectively. Wild goats, snow leopards, bears, etc. are found in the Himalayan region. Besides these, monkeys, wolf, jackal, nilgai, cheetal, etc. are other animals found in our country.<br />\nOur country is rich in bird life too. Peacock is our national bird. Other common birds are parrots, pigeons, mynah, geese, bulbul and ducks. Several bird sanctuaries have been established to protect different species of birds. There are hundreds of species of snakes found in India. Cobras and Kraits are important among them.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Hindi - VI", "NCERT Solutions - VI", "1. वह चिड़िया जो ", "वह चिड़िया जो ", 1, "<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>NCERT Solutions for Class 6 Hindi Chapter 1</strong></h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/5a8fd733-530d-4ca0-b300-99eb088fdc22_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-01.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/7395452e-7344-4b24-a5b5-853c2ccf1ce0_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-02.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/1eacc140-630e-45fa-accc-df41a4df6d5a_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-03.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/d83b85fb-6185-4f0c-a4a0-0e83a265c16b_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-04.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/6cef1527-46df-4af4-acf8-aef8d42e4763_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-05.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/6e0d87b9-b12b-41a0-8291-2efe91478674_class-6-hindi-chapter-1-06.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n" ], [ "VI", "Hindi -

This story has a lot of rhyming words, as a poem does. Can you write out some parts of it like a poem, so that the rhymes come at the end of separate lines? For example:</strong><br />\nPatrick never did homework. &lsquo;Too boring&rdquo;, he said.<br />\nHe played baseball and Hockey and Nintendo instead.<br />\n<strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp;The man of the tiniest size<br />\nwas true to his word and wise<br />\nPatiick saved the elf from the cat<br />\nThe elf promised to do all that<br />\nPatrick loved sports and hated homewor<br />\nHe wasted his time, and studies shirk</p>\n\n<p><strong>B.

In this group are such varied ani&shy;mals as bears, pandas, raccoons, cats, hyenas, and even seal. The dog or canine family has many wild species like wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and wild dogs.<br />\nThe dog is the only domesticated member of the canine family though now and then someone tames a wolf, fox or coyote as a pet. All members of the dog family are descendants of a wolf-like animal which lived about 15 million years ago. From this distant ancestor, the true dogs gradually developed. But nobody knows the exact ancestor of the modem domestic dog.<br />\nSeveral wild dogs look and behave like domestic dogs. The dingo or wild dog of Australia is one of these. It is possible that the dingo was a tamed dog brought to Australia long ago which then ran wild.<br />\nDogs were the first animals tamed by humans&mdash;perhaps 20,000 years ago. Tamed dogs were brought from Asia to the New world 5,000 or more years ago.

Algu heard the voice of his conscience and did justice. But Jumman waited for his turn to take revenge. He got that chance soon. Algu was being cheated by Sahu. Hence, a panchayat was held. Sahu named Jumman as head Panch. But as soon as Jumman occupied that seat of responsibility, he too decided the case on facts and merit. His verdict in favour of Algu brought them closer once again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Which is more desirable-friendship or enmity? When does a person hear strongly the voice of his conscience?</strong><br />\n<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;It goes without saying that friendship is based on goodwill and respect for one another. Enmity is created by hatred and ill-will. Friendship is definitely far better than enmity. Every person has a weakness for friends. But the moment he occupies the seat of judgement, he hears the voice of his conscience and gives a fair verdict.</p>\n" ], [ "VI", "English - VI", "NCERT Solutions Honeysuckle - VI", "8.
